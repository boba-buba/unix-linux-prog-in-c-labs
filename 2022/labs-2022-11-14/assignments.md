Create a program that produces selected number of zombies and then exits.
Observe the zombies being handled by the init(8) process.

Check the state of the zombie processes with ps(1).

Note: on some systems, the child reaping functionality of init was subsumed into
service management daemons such as `systemd`.

usage: `./a.out <zombie_num>`
